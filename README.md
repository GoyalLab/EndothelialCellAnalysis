This is the code repository for Moise et al. The segmentationPipeline folder has the Jupyter notebooks for segmenting the cell and measuring different properties of the cell. The plottingDataAndPlot folder has scripts used to create the data for plots (elongation and orientation) and plot figure wise. The helper scripts are for tasks like making names consistent, subsampling data or reorganising folder strcture.
